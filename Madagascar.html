<p>Madagascar (/ˌmædəˈɡæskər, -kɑːr/; Malagasy: Madagasikara), officially the Republic of Madagascar (Malagasy: Repoblikan'i Madagasikara, Malagasy pronunciation: [republiˈkʲan madaɡasˈkʲarə̥]; French: République de Madagascar), is an island country in the Indian Ocean, approximately 400 kilometres (250 miles) off the coast of East Africa across the Mozambique Channel. At 592,800 square kilometres (228,900 sq mi) Madagascar is the world's second-largest island country, after Indonesia.[14] The nation is home to around 30 million inhabitants and consists of the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), along with numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian subcontinent around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is endemic.

    Human settlement of Madagascar occurred during or before the mid first millennium AD[15] by Austronesian peoples, presumably arriving on outrigger canoes from present-day Indonesia. These were joined around the 9th century AD by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa. Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time, each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. The Malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more subgroups, of which the largest are the Merina of the central highlands.

    Until the late 18th century, the island of Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances. Beginning in the early 19th century, most of the island was united and ruled as the Kingdom of Madagascar by a series of Merina nobles. The monarchy ended in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the French colonial empire, from which the island gained independence in 1960. The autonomous state of Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed republics. Since 1992, the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at Antananarivo. However, in a 2009 political crisis, president Marc Ravalomanana was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009 to Andry Rajoelina. Constitutional governance was restored in January 2014, when Hery Rajaonarimampianina was named president following a 2013 election deemed fair and transparent by the international community. Madagascar is a member of the United Nations, the African Union (AU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie.

    Madagascar belongs to the group of least developed countries, according to the United Nations.[18] Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state. Christianity is predominant religion in the country, but a significant minority still practices traditional faiths. Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health, and private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar's development strategy. Under Ravalomanana, these investments produced substantial economic growth, but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class. As of 2017, the economy has been weakened by the 2009–2013 political crisis, and quality of life remains low for the majority of the Malagasy population</p>

<h3>Red ruffed lemur</h3>

<h5>Red ruffed lemurs are designed for leaping</h5>
<p>Some of the largest lemurs, red ruffed lemurs have the typical lemur appearance, with their hind legs longer than front. With opposable great toes and those extra-long hind legs, they are designed for leaping. Typically, the red ruffed lemur will cling vertically, look over its shoulder, and leap. While in the air, it will pivot and swing the hind legs forward in-flight, landing hind-feet first. Then, it will pull in and grasp with the front feet.

    They also tend to hang by those long legs while eating, grasping the tree limb with their hind feet. Red ruffed lemurs enjoy being in the trees and hardly come to the ground.</p>

<h5>Red ruffed lemurs love to talk</h5>
<p>Like us, red ruffed lemurs have their own way of communicating with each other. From gathering everyone together to warning others of a potential intruder, they have at least six distinctive calls. There are roars, barks, squeaks, and purrs, each with its own meaning. The roar of the red ruffed lemurs can be heard all over Fresno Chaffee Zoo—it sounds like a fight, but they’re simply saying, “We’re all here!”</p>

<h5>Red ruffed lemurs are important pollinators.</h5>
<p>Red ruffed lemurs are frugivores, so they consume lots of fruit and nectar, as well as leaves, flowers, and seeds. Red ruffed lemurs love figs, which is usually their favorite fruit to have. Since red ruffed lemurs eat such large quantities of nectar, particularly during the flowering season, they are actually important pollinators. The pollen sticks to their long, furry snouts and they carry it from plant to plant. In fact, they are the primary pollinator of the Traveler’s Palm, a tree native to their home in Madagascar.</p>

<h3>RING-TAILED LEMUR</h3>

<h5>The Most Recognizable Lemur</h5>
<p>Cat-sized, the very long tail is the Ring-Tail’s most distinctive feature, carried straight up with a cane-crook at the tip. Lemur hind legs are longer than the front, more pronounced in arboreal species. The muzzle has touch-sensitive vibrissae (whiskers) and the nose is a bare, wet rhinarium. The hind foot has a typical thumb-like great toe. There is a grooming claw (a laterally compressed nail tip) on the index toe. They have a number of scent glands. Unlike other lemurid species, the Ring-Tail has a tapetum lucidum.

    The various lemurs developed in isolation from monkeys, and without big predators, on the large island of Madagascar. Lemur means “ghost” in Latin. The name refers to their nocturnal and somewhat ethereal behavior, although the Ring-Tail is not really nocturnal. Family Lemuridae, besides genus Lemur, includes Varecia, Eulemur, Hapalemur and Prolemur. Species that were once in genus Lemur are now considered genus Eulemur (IUCN). The Ring-Tail is now the only species in the genus. Catta is a New Latin version of “cat.”</p>

<h5>Range</h5>
<p>Ringtails inhabit deciduous forests to arid bush forests, preferring the gallery forests and Euphorbia bush of southern Madagascar.</p>

<h5>Diet</h5>
<p>Wild – Fruits, primarily figs and the hard-coated fig-thistle; also flowers, leaves and insects.
    Zoo – Monkey chow, fruits and vegetables, insects.</p>

<h5>Behavior</h5>
<p>With a few exceptions, true lemurs are diurnal. The Ring-Tail is almost completely terrestrial. Diurnal lemurs seek sunlight, especially in the morning, and sunbathe. They sit with legs extended, taking on what resembles the Yoga lotus position, and absorb heat. When eating, lemurs bite hard shells and skins off with the incisors, but actually bite the fruit with the molars, tipping the head so that any juice runs into the mouth. They seldom soil their fur. Ring-Tails, the only true lemurs with “stink” glands, use their glandular secretions to mark their territory. The wet rhinarium is associated with a keen sense of smell and lemurs are keenly olfactory. Ring-Tails have a large gland on the inside of each wrist and males have one at each armpit. Male to male confrontations involve stink-fights, although it is unclear how they declare a winner. They sit and draw their tails alternatingly through both armpits, smearing the scent thoroughly through the fur. They then stand face to face and shake their tails in the direction of the adversary. And the winner is……? Lemurs also have, and make use of anal glands.

    Vocalizations are often shrill but distance between troops is maintained by howling. There is a lot of mewing and purring when groups huddle together for warmth. They sleep curled in a ball, tucking hands, feet and face into the center. The tail is thrown up over the face and down the back.</p>

<h5>Adaptation</h5>
<p>True lemurs do not swim well and seldom enter water. The long hind limbs make for excellent leaping. The most terrestrial, the Ring-Tail, can jump vertically up to 3 meters. If they take to the trees, they prefer heavier branches, especially the more horizontal and flattened ones. The toe arrangement and modified toenails, plus toe pads, add to their gripping ability. The leaps are launched with the powerful hind legs, which are then swung forward to receive the impact of the landing.

    Even though they are primarily diurnal, the Ring-Tail is the only lemurid that has the specialized night-vision involving the reflective tapetum (mirror) in the eyes’ retina. The eyes “glow” in dim light when the viewer sees the reflected light passing back out of the eye. This and the fact that they are the only ones with stink-glands was a major factor in making the genus monospecific.

    Specialized lower incisors and incisiform canines form a tooth-comb for acquiring tree gum during times of difficulty. These teeth are also used in grooming.</p>

<h5>Breeding & Growth</h5>
<p>Ring-Tails are very social, with their group size ranging to 30, but averaging 15. There tends to be more males than females in each group, and females are the dominant members. Females stay with their group for their life-time, males move around. Interactions within the group may be aggressive, with females and males having their own hierarchy. The male hierarchy breaks down during the breeding season. The male surplus seems to be the stimulating factor during the “rut.” The Ring Tail territories are fairly large, ranging from 15 to 50 some acres, depending on food availability.

    The breeding season is only about 2 weeks long, with each female only in estrous about one day. Gestation is about 130 days. Newborn eyes are blue, taking a few months to turn the brilliant yellow. The young are raised by the entire group. The young begin to climb at about 3 weeks and soon begin to feed, returning to the mother for nursing and to sleep. Although sexual maturity is reached by 18 months, it is another year before young males are developed enough and strong enough to take on a mature female. The average wild life-span is about 7 years.</p>
