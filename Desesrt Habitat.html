     Alt="Desert Habitat" height=420 width=420>
<p>A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to denudation. About one-third of the land surface of the Earth is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions, where little precipitation occurs, and which are sometimes called polar deserts or "cold deserts". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.

    Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put strains on the rocks, which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter, and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor are further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust, which can remain airborne for extended periods – sometimes causing the formation of sand storms or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas are known as desert pavements, and little further erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground sources of water, in the form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found, oases can occur.

    Plants and animals living in the desert need special adaptations to survive in the harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, water-resistant cuticles, and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die in the course of a few weeks after rainfall, while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal, and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again during the rare rainfall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.

    People have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available, and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life. The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil and is one of the causes of increased desertification. Desert farming is possible with the aid of irrigation, and the Imperial Valley in California provides an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source. Many trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across the Sahara, and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara. Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts, and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of solar energy.</p>

<h3>Warthog</h3>

     Alt="warthog" height=420 width=420>

<h5>More Specialized than Most Pigs</h5>
<p>Warthogs are sparsely haired with a long and bristly mane down the neck to the middle of the back. The legs are relatively longer than most pigs. Males have 3 pairs of “warts,” 1 near the eyes, 1 on the snout and 1 pair on the lower jaw. The female’s two pair of warts are smaller, with none on the snout. The eyes are set high on the head. They have a typical pig’s disc-like nose pad. The hooves are relatively small, with four toes on each foot. Digit 2 and 5 are reduced, more so on the hind. They have a relatively long, tasseled tail.</p>

<h5>Range</h5>
<p>Warthogs use grasslands and open woodlands across most of sub-Saharan Africa. The Desert is on the Ethiopia/Somali border south into Kenya. The Common is widely distributed across Central and most of Southern Africa. Both species occupy areas much drier than other pigs, but the Common – apparently – does not inhabit the drier range of the Desert Warthog. Regardless, they are usually within walking distance of water.</p>

<h5>Coloration</h5>
<p>Warthogs are over-all gray but may look red or some other color from wallow-ing. Young animals have white wart whiskers. Newborns have a hint of striping.</p>

<h5>Diet</h5>
<p>Wild – Warthogs, more specialized than most pigs, are primarily grazers. They do root, taking bulbs, rhizomes and various worms and insects.
    Zoo – Grass hay and alfalfa, vegetables and greens..</p>

<h5>Behavior</h5>
<p>Warthogs are diurnal. Their temperature tolerances are limited and a deep burrow is essential. The burrows are used for protection from fluctuations in temperature and humidity as well as predators. The young go into the burrow head first, as they are able to turn around inside, but the adults back in – weapons facing out. Warthogs can dig but a used burrow is preferred. Most abandoned burrows created by Aardvarks are taken over by Warthogs. Warthogs prefer short succulent grasses, which they pluck with the lips and “unique” incisors. Longer grasses are pulled with the teeth. The tusks are not used to dig. The hard-edged, well-muscled snout is used to root food, particularly during the dry season or after fires.

    Warthogs do wallow. Coating the body with mud acts as insect repellent and sun screen. The tail is an effective fly-swat and it telegraphs mood. They run with the tail standing straight up. If the mane is raised, it is for intimidation. The mane is laid down flat in appeasement. In friendly encounters, they greet nose to nose. All pigs are highly vocal. Home range territories and other members of one’s band are marked, with preorbital glands. They live in groups of females and young. With safety in numbers, several families may travel together. The band associations are loose. Sexually active males are primarily solitary while non-breeding males form bachelor groups.</p>

<h5>Adaptation</h5>
<p>Because of their rather long legs, Warthogs are quite fast if they have to run. They kneel to graze and usually rise hind quarters first to stand. Callosities, present on the carpal (wrist) joints, are not just calluses, they develop before birth, much like those in camels. The eye-placement, high on the skull, allows for keen vision even when kneeling.

    Pigs generally have a simple stomach, much like humans. Pigs have bunodont teeth, also similar to humans, with fairly high crowns. As the animal matures, however, warthog premolars are lost and the 1st and 2nd molars regress. The 3rd molar moves forward and enlarges. Older animals have one huge molar in each jaw. Tusks are ever-growing canine teeth. Tuskless sub-adults, especially males, have white hair tufts on the lower warts that are lost as the animal matures. Why is not known and one author suggests they give illusion of tusks. However, a sub-adult would not want to advertise tusks if he was not ready to spar. Perhaps the illusion is for predators.

    Vision is poor but hearing and sense of smell are excellent. Warthogs scent-mark with lip glands and preorbital glands. The upper tusks grow out, up, and around the snout. The lower tusks are short and sharp. Both tusks are triangular in cross-section. The short, stout, lower tusks are used for defense. With the mouth closed, the upper and lower tusks occlude together, forming a diamond and the upper tusks are thus back-stopped during the ritual sparring. Females sometimes spar also.

    Warthog warts serve to protect the eyes and jaw from the hammer-like punches delivered during ritualized head duels. Contests of strength are usually tusk-to-tusk and forehead-to-forehead pushing matches. Low sideways blows are wicked and violent fights are bloody, but such escalations are rare. These sorts of mouth-open blows are usually reserved for confrontations with predators. Lower tusks are sharp weapons that will produce huge gashes. The mouth is usually kept closed during ritualized sparring, with the upper and lower tusks clamped together.</p>

<h5>Breeding & Growth</h5>
<p>Breeding is heralded by lip-gland pheromones. Gestation is 170-175 days and, even though the female has 4 mammae, she usually delivers only 2 precocial piglets. She leaves them in a grass-lined burrow during the day, returning 2 or 3 times to suckle them. They emerge from the burrow at 2 weeks, but stay close and dive back in if alarmed. They eat grass almost immediately and, keeping close physical contact with the mother, they begin to follow at 6 or 8 weeks. They are sexually mature at about 18 months, but males do not breed for about 4 years. They have to earn the right by physical prowess, and their tusks are not well developed until about 5 years. Wild longevity is up to 10 years, but 15 or more in captivity.</p>

     Alt="Cheetah" height=420 width=420>

<h5>The Fastest Animal on Land</h5>
<p>Considered a ‘big cat’ only because it is tall, the Cheetah is actually the same overall size as our Cougar (Felis concolor). Cats, generally, are obviously longer than they are tall, with powerfully muscular legs. The Cheetah is ‘square’ – the same height to the withers as it is long (from chest to rump). Elements of the legs are long and lean, especially the radius/ulna, tibia/fibula, metacarpals (the palm) and metatarsals (the ‘foot’). The skull is about the same size as the Cougar, but is slightly more domed, back to front. The tail is long enough to touch the ground with the Cheetah standing. Although a cub’s claws can, to some degree, retract, adult Cheetah claws do not retract and are, therefore, blunted. Males are slightly larger than females, but with no other sexual dimorphism.</p>

<h5>Range</h5>
<p>Cheetahs need wide expanses of grassland. Gallery forest and heavy brush interfere with their ability to run. Cheetahs do well in more arid habitats. They occur in the band of Sub-Saharan savannah that stretches across northern Africa, down the eastern grasslands south of Somalia and across southern Africa westward into the Kalahari Desert region. There is a small population near the mouth of the Red Sea, in Ethiopia, and another that may still exist at the southern end of the Caspian Sea, in Iran.</p>

<h5>Diet</h5>
<p>Wild – Cheetahs generally take hoofed mammals of less than 90 pounds (gazelle to young wildebeest). They also take small prey such as hares, warthogs and birds.
    Zoo – Feline diet, plus beef, rabbits and chicks.</p>

<h5>Behavior</h5>
<p>Cheetah are tall, they are not big cats. They are about the same size, over all, as the Mountain Lion (a.k.a. Cougar, Felis concolor). They must be secretive because these solitary cats have few of the adaptations that other cats have. They have difficulty defending themselves or their cubs against such antagonists as lions, leopard or hyena all of which would steal the Cheetah’s prey or kill Cheetah cubs, if the opportunity arose..</p>

<h5>Adaptation</h5>
<p>The Cheetah is, indeed, the fastest animal on land. It is said that the Cheetah can accelerate faster than most cars. National Geographic says “0 to 60 in only 3 seconds.” The thing more amazing than their speed is their agility. Cheetah can make quick, sudden turns, during prey-pursuit, and that is dependent upon the use of the long tail. The Cheetah will whip the tail side to side in order to maintain balance in a sharp turn.

    The Cheetah’s keen binocular vision picks up the slightest movement as they scan the grassland. Its spotted coat keeps it well camouflaged while lounging under a bush, and its shape and coat-color allow it to meld into tall, dry grasses. Prey is approached with stealth, the timing must be perfect. The chase is usually over in less than a minute, and the Cheetah expends a great deal of energy in that short time. In fact, the Cheetah cannot really run longer than about 2 minutes because its body temperature rises very rapidly during such exertion. Even when a kill is made, the Cheetah must pant to cool itself down before eating.

    Built like a greyhound, the Cheetah’s back flexes and extends, as it runs, so that its hind feet far surpass the front legs before hitting the ground to begin the next thrust and stride. As it runs, the Cheetah’s head hardly moves from level, its focus is to match the prey animal’s every move. It has no grappling-hook claws with which to grab, it cannot even supinate its paw [turn it palm-up] as other cats can. The Cheetah is a pursuit hunter, not a lie-in-wait hunter, and it must breast the fleeing quarry and trip it knocking the prey down is the only way to stop it.

    When the prey falls, it is equally amazing that the Cheetah goes from 60 to stop almost instantly, as it grabs the prey in the choke-hold necessary to dispatch it. Once the kill is made, the Cheetah tries to conceal the fact by dragging it into hiding. Other hunters, like an observant lion, will move toward the action as soon as a Cheetah starts its run. Cheetahs are usually successful (once they start a run) and it is easier for the lion to take that kill than to capture prey itself.</p>

<h5>Breeding & Growth</h5>
<p>Cheetah are generally solitary, although brothers may stay in a group called a coalition. Breeding is usually timed so that the cubs will be born at the beginning of the wet season … their survivability is greater (50% of all cubs born will die before they are 3 months old – starvation or predation). The typical litter is 3 altricial cubs. Cub eyes will open at about 10 days, but they will stay in seclusion for several more weeks. At 3 or 4 months they will begin to follow their mother and share her kill. In fact, the cubs usually eat first because the huntress must pant to cool down after the run and the kill cannot be lost to thieves. Cubs will stay with her for as much as 2 years. They have much to learn. Wild longevity is about 12 years but Cheetah may reach 17 or more in captivity.

    The cubs demonstrate an adaptive coloration feature. Newborn cubs are blue-gray to black, with a crest of white hair down their backs. This color pattern is does resemble the fierce mustelid predator called the Ratel, or Honey Badger (Mellivora capensis). The color fades to the well-known spotted coat as the cubs become more capable. Although the hypothesis has never been tested, the illusion of ‘Honey Badger’ may well protect the youngsters from predation in certain instances. Even the largest predators are loathe to face a Ratel</p>
