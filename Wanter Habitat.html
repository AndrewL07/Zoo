<p>Fresh water or freshwater is any naturally occurring liquid or frozen water containing low concentrations of dissolved salts and other total dissolved solids. Although the term specifically excludes seawater and brackish water, it does include non-salty mineral-rich waters such as chalybeate springs. Fresh water may encompass frozen and meltwater in ice sheets, ice caps, glaciers, snowfields and icebergs, natural precipitations such as rainfall, snowfall, hail/sleet and graupel, and surface runoffs that form inland bodies of water such as wetlands, ponds, lakes, rivers, streams, as well as groundwater contained in aquifers, subterranean rivers and lakes. Fresh water is the water resource that is of the most and immediate use to humans.

    Water is critical to the survival of all living organisms. Many organisms can thrive on salt water, but the great majority of higher plants and most insects, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds need fresh water to survive.

    Fresh water is not always potable water, that is, water safe to drink by humans. Much of the earth's fresh water (on the surface and groundwater) is to a substantial degree unsuitable for human consumption without some treatment. Fresh water can easily become polluted by human activities or due to naturally occurring processes, such as erosion. Fresh water makes up less than 3% of the world's water resources, and just 1% of that is readily available. Just 3% of it is extracted for human consumption. Agriculture uses roughly two thirds of all fresh water abstracted from the environment.

    Fresh water is a renewable and variable, but finite natural resource. Fresh water is replenished through the process of the water cycle, in which water from seas, lakes, forests, land, rivers and reservoirs evaporates, forms clouds, and returns inland as precipitation. Locally, however, if more fresh water is consumed through human activities than is naturally restored, this may result in reduced fresh water availability (or water scarcity) from surface and underground sources and can cause serious damage to surrounding and associated environments. Water pollution also reduces the availability of fresh water.</p>

<h3>Cownose Ray</h3>

Alt="Cownose Ray" height=420 width=420>

<h5>Its Squared, Indented Snout Resembles a Cow’s Nose</h5>
<p>All of the ray group are quite dorso-ventrally flat and have their mouths on the ventral side. Being cartilaginous fish, there are no bones at all, the skeleton is completely cartilage. Most rays do not have teeth, as sharks do, but rather have a “bony” plate, top and bottom, with strong jaws. Rays have one or more envenom-mating stingers on their tails. Ray species vary from 10 inches to over 6 feet in width.</p>

<h5>Range</h5>
<p>Rays in general prefer tropical and semitropical waters. Cow-Noses and Southern Rays range from Southern New England south to Florida and into the Gulf of Mexico. The warm Gulf Stream swings up along New England, then across the Atlantic and south by the British Isles … the path of hurricanes. Many warm-water animals follow these warm currents and are found much farther north than one would expect. Warm weather takes the rays north and winter sends them migrating into the Gulf of Mexico (clockwise from Florida to the Mexican Yucatan).</p>

<h5>Coloration</h5>
<p>The entire ray group – as well as sharks – demonstrates the camouflage called counter-shading. The back is some shade of dark to match the ocean floor, when viewed from above, and the belly is light or white to be bright against the brightness at the water’s surface, when viewed from below. Many, many marine and fresh-water animals demonstrate counter-shading, including orcas, penguins and trout.</p>

<h5>Diet</h5>
<p>Wild – Mollusks, crustaceans and small fishes.
    Zoo – Fresh-frozen chopped fish and shrimp.</p>

<h5>Behavior</h5>
<p>Rays move by undulating their bodies up and down like a wave, or by flapping their pectoral fins like wings. These fins are often referred to as “wings.” When resting, rays lie buried in the substrate, often with only their eyes showing. This can be to the detriment of swimmers or divers who inadvertently step on them. Stepping on the spine or getting stabbed with that spine is immediately quite painful. It is suggested that swimmers, walking on the bottom, shuffle their feet. The rays will swoosh out of the way.

    Rays often visit the “cleaning stations” of the Bluehead Wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) and the Spanish Hogfish (Bodianus rufus), fish that clean excess mucous from the skin and eat parasites from the skin and gills. Fish visiting these cleaning stations will affect a pose, with the mouth and gill covers open, much like the Galapagos Tortoise (Geochelone elephantopus) does for the Galapa-gos Finches (Geospiza species). The cleaners swim in and out, picking parasites and food particles.</p>

<h5>Adaptation</h5>
<p>A mucilaginous skin coating makes rays (and most fish) slippery, helping them to glide through the water faster. It also protects them from dehydration and helps protect them from invading pathogens. This mucous makes the fish feel very smooth, it is not at all “slime,” like that produced by hagfish (Myxinidae)for predator protection, and the mucous is certainly not dangerous to humans. The subtended mouth allows for easy gathering of prey from the substrate. The large, flat tooth-plates are used to crush the shells of their prey. Soft body parts are swallowed, the crushed shells spit out.

    A question comes from the presence of this hard tooth plate. How can this be when the fish has a cartilaginous skeleton with no bones? The mechanism has been likened to fossilization. An animal (or plant) literally becomes a rock as soft tissues are replaced by a process of mineralization. Biologist Adam Summers of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, reports that – somehow – the stingray deposits minerals as a strong coating in and around its jaws. A columnar structure acts as reinforcing struts within its jaw cartilage and a crushing plate is formed. Summers’ discovery marks the first time an animal has been found using mineralization deep in its cartilage for structural purposes.

    One feature of Stingrays that is certain to draw attention is the “stinger,” the spine (or spines) on the ray’s tail. The stingrays in the touch-tank have had their barbs trimmed — it is painless, like cutting a long fingernail.</p>

<h5>Breeding & Growth</h5>
<p>Ray mating season is usually in winter. Courting males will follow the female closely, biting at her (watch for “hickies” on our rays). During mating, the male swims above the female, placing one clasper into her vent. Ovovivi-parous females have litters, the embryos being kept in the womb without a placenta. Embryos absorb yolk-sac nutrients, and, after the sac is depleted, the mother provides a uterine “milk.” Cow-Nose Rays and Southern Stingrays often give birth in protected Mangroves. Longevity for most stingrays is not known.</p>

<h3>California sea lion </h3>

     Alt="California sea lion" height=420 width=420>

<h5>Adapted for Movement on Land and Water</h5>
<p>Sea Lions show extreme sexual dimorphism. The lighter, longer hair of the crest and upper neck give males a maned appearance, hence sea LION. “Eared Seal” ears are small and cone-like around the ear openings. True seals have no pinnae. Eared Seals have long vibrissae and heavier muzzles than seals, and they are quadrupedal.

    Appearing black when they are wet, Sea Lions are brown. During the molt, they are blotchy as the sun-bleached old hair is replaced by the true-color new pelage. The woolly pups are coffee-brown to black at birth, becoming their adult color with the 6-month molt.</p>

<h5>Range</h5>
<p>California Sea Lions are found from the tip of Baja to the Alaskan Gulf, primarily along coastlines with sandy or rocky beaches. They predominantly forage the Continental Shelf.</p>

<h5>Diet</h5>
<p>Wild – Varied sea life, preferring fish, squid and octopus, but also take crustaceans and urchins.
    Zoo – Squid and fish (during any time in freshwater, salt pellets/vitamins inserted in the fish).</p>

<h5>Behavior</h5>
<p>Sea Lions are rarely more than 20 miles out to sea, concentrating activities in areas of cool-water upwelling, where food is the most plentiful. Their populations are greatly affected by the warming seen in severe El Niño years. They seem, however, to recover within 4 – 5 years.

    They feed on whatever is abundant, and seldom deep-dive. Enemies include sharks, orcas and humans. Sea Lions haul out to rest and to sleep at night, and breakwaters are a favorite. They fold back the cartilaginous extensions on their hind flippers to use the strong claws on the three middle toes for scratching. The front claws are vestigial. Vocalizations are sharp barks, throaty chortles and honks.</p>

<h5>Adaptation</h5>
<p>The breeding strategy of pinnipeds like Sea Lions favors larger-sized males. Large males are better able to defend territories, they need less energy per unit of body weight and can survive long periods of fasting, a necessity since they cannot leave their territories to feed. Larger bulls are more successful, producing more offspring with the DNA for larger size. Sea Lions have no value as fur-bearers, their fur is very short. They are highly adapted to an aquatic life, their modified limbs mostly enclosed within the body. The hands and feet are long, flattened and fully webbed. They move surprisingly fast on land, traveling more easily than true seals because they can stand on sideways-turned hands and feet, actually walking. The structure of the shoulder and arm allows an easy figure-eight for powering the swimming. Steering is accomplished with the hind limbs. Swimming with ultimate grace, Sea Lions are agile, rapid swimmers, catching fast-moving prey.

    Thick blubber beneath the skin smoothes the shape to the classic no-drag torpedo, provides buoyancy and insulates against cold. All diving pinnipeds show many physiological adaptations that conserve oxygen, including: slowed heart rate, slowed metabolism, dropped body temperature, high tolerance to carbon dioxide in the tissues, myoglobin (able to store large amounts of oxygen in muscle tissues) and collapsing the lungs before the dive. Expelling air from the lungs effectively limits gas-exchange in the lungs, avoiding the condition known as the bends (nitrogen bubbles in the blood) on ascent.

    The nostrils are slits that are tightly closed and are forced open by special muscles. Incisors and canines are carnivore-like but premolars and molars are peg-like and interdigitated for grabbing and holding. Prey is swallowed whole. The hairless soles of the flippers are well-supplied with blood vessels and sweat glands. The flippers are waved when the animal is hot. Pinnipeds have large eyes and the shape of the lens adjusts for differences in light refraction in air and water. Very long vibrissae (whiskers) may help detect vibrations under water. They are quite stiff and definitely help balance the ball during circus tricks. Hearing is acute. California Sea Lions produce sounds both in and out of water and are known as one of the noisiest Otariids.</p>

<h5>Breeding & Growth</h5>
<p>Otariids are polygynous (“many females”) and bulls maintain a “harem” of 5 to 20 cows for the breeding season. A dominant bull uses the same rookery year after year but each year a new “harem” is established. Bulls arrive first to establish their territories. Cows regularly gather in groups. Dominant bulls defend access to a group of females, the cow chooses the group and the stretch of beach within which she wants to have her calf. A bull cannot actively pursue a cow without leaving his territory. He does his best to keep the cows in his territory from leaving.

    Cows come ashore 2 to 3 weeks after the bulls, about 2 days before their pups arrive. As each pup is born, the cow will vocalize and sniff at the pup, which responds vocally. This immediate vocal and olfactory recognition is very important for maintaining the mother/pup bond. The suckling pup gets very rich milk (36% fat, 14% protein) and grows rapidly. Cows come into heat about 8 days after calving and leave for the sea to feed soon after breeding. When a cow leaves, her pup moves to the back of the breeding beach, with the other pups. This keeps them out of the way of still-ardent bulls.

    Pups are often trampled in territorial and breeding scrambles. Bulls are unconcerned because the pups, conceived last breeding season, are probably not his. The mother returns weekly for 4 months, goes to the crèche of pups and calls. Answered with the birth-call, Mother confirms recognition with a sniff and leads the pup to a secluded place so it can nurse. The pups swim in tide pools at first and later go into the sea with their mothers. Cows begin to breed at 3 years of age, the bulls at 5 years or more. A fully crested Beach Master is closer to 10. Life expectancy is 12 to 15 years wild, and 30 in captivity.</p>
