<p>A forest is an area of land dominated by trees. Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world,<br> incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing, and ecological function. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines a forest as, "Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban use." Using this definition, Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 (FRA 2020) found that forests covered 4.06 billion hectares (10.0 billion acres; 40.6 million square kilometres; 15.7 million square miles), or approximately 31 percent of the world's land area in 2020.

    Forests are the predominant terrestrial ecosystem of Earth, and are found around the globe.<br> More than half of the world's forests are found in only five countries (Brazil, Canada, China, the Russian Federation, and the United States of America). The largest share of forests (45 percent) are in the tropical latitudes, followed by those in the boreal, temperate, and subtropic domains.

    Forests account for 75% of the gross primary production of the Earth's biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass.<br> Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes of biomass per year for tropical forests, 8.1 for temperate forests, and 2.6 for boreal forests.

    Forests at different latitudes and elevations,<br> and with different precipitation and evapotranspiration[9] form distinctly different biomes: boreal forests around the North Pole, tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests around the Equator, and temperate forests at the middle latitudes. Areas at higher elevations tend to support forests similar to those at higher latitudes, and the amount of precipitation also affects forest composition.

    Almost half the forest area (49 percent) is relatively intact,<br> while 9 percent is found in fragments with little or no connectivity. Tropical rainforests and boreal coniferous forests are the least fragmented, whereas subtropical dry forests and temperate oceanic forests are among the most fragmented. Roughly 80 percent of the world's forest area is found in patches larger than 1 million hectares (2.5 million acres). The remaining 20 percent is located in more than 34 million patches around the world – the vast majority less than 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) in size.

    Human society and forests influence each other in both positive and negative ways.<br> Forests provide ecosystem services to humans and serve as tourist attractions. Forests can also affect people's health. Human activities, including unsustainable use of forest resources, can negatively affect forest ecosystems.</p>

<h3>Red Wolf</h3>

     Alt="Red Wolf" height=420 width=420>

<h5>The Most Endangered Wolf</h5>
<p> Intermediate in size between the gray wolf (Canis lupus) and the coyote (Canis latrans), red wolves look something like large coyotes.</p>

<h5>Range</h5>
<p>Historical – Red wolves originally occupied eastern North America, from the Gulf Coast into southern Ontario, Canada. Current – Extinct in the wild in 1980, Red wolves are now in a captive breeding-and-release program. The primary wild release area is eastern North Carolina, on the peninsula between the Albermarle and Pamilico Sounds. Low human density, wetland soil type and distance from roads seem to be the most important habitat features.</p>

<h5>Diet</h5>
Wild – Rabbits, squirrels, fawns, birds and eggs, plus insects and reptiles as available.
Zoo – Canine Maintenance, with frozen feline; fasted weekly; bone or muscle meat weekly.
Coloration
Red wolves are cinnamon or tawny, with black-tipped guard hairs. The ears are usually red and the tail-tip black. The summer coat is more reddish than the dense winter coat. In all seasons, the “eyebrows” and fur along the lips is cream.

<h5>Behavior</h5>
<p>Red wolves seldom form large packs and mostly hunt smaller mammals like raccoons, rabbits, and deer. Red Wolves seldom howl, but when they do it is more reminiscent of coyote chortling. The young especially, do a lot of singing and chortling. Red Wolves are mostly nocturnal, but may be more active during the day in the winter.</p>

<h5>Adaptation</h5>
<p>Red Wolves have long thin legs, typical of running hunters. Hearing and vision are keen, necessary for being nocturnal predators, and the sense of smell is excellent.

    There is a definite change in coat, summer being short and coarse, almost slick-coated, and winter being double and soft.</p>

<h5>Breeding & Growth</h5>
<p>Red Wolves mate for life. Gestation is about 60 days. Usually 4 altricial pups are born, the eyes opening after about 2 weeks. They begin joining the hunt at about 5 months, just after their deciduous canines drop out and the permanent ones begin to come in. Pups will stay with the pack for 1 to 3 years, helping to raise their younger siblings.</p>

<h3>Colobus Monkey</h3>

     Alt="Colobus Monkey" height=420 width=420>

<h5>Black-and-White Colobus</h5>
<p> A medium-sized monkey of moderately heavy build, Colobus are part of an arbitrary group called Leaf Monkeys, with large bellies because of the diet. The hair is fairly long, with the Guereza’s fringe twice as long as the rest of the coat, as is the brush on the tail. The ischial callosities are quarter-size, separate in females and connected by a bar in males. The fur on newborns is kinky-wavy and short.</p>

<h5>Range</h5>
<p>The nominate subspecies, Colobus g. guereza, is found in the Ethiopian highland tropical moist and gallery forests, west of the Rift Valley and down into the lowland forests of the Awash and Omo Rivers and the Blue Nile gorge.</p>

<h5>Diet</h5>
<p>Wild – Folivorous, also taking fruits and blossoms (obtain minerals by eating soil).
Zoo – Monkey chow, spinach and various lettuce leaves, chopped fruit and vegetables.</p>

<h5>Behavior</h5>
<p>An animal separated from its group emits a guttural “orr-orr-orr” call. The troop responds immediately. This vocalization is territorial (called acoustical marking) and is taken up by the entire troop during its daily rounds. Distressed young squeak, with quick response from mom. Feeding Colobus move slowly and deliberately, quietly pulling leaves and buds off. They apparently prefer young leaves, changing locations when all the tender leaves are gone. Colobus circulate through well-defined feeding territories of about 40 acres. Seldom flighty, they show some hierarchy with a few other species. Baboons are dominant, then a large hornbill, then Guerezas and finally White-Throated (Red-bellied) Guenon (Cercopithecus erythrogaster).</p>

<h5>Adaptation</h5>
<p>Colobus are almost completely arboreal. They are outstanding jumpers, able to leap great distances, tree to tree. Some observers feel that the beautiful long white hair (much sought-after for high-fashion coats) serves as a kind of parachute, slowing their landing speed. It does billow out and would create drag, but no actual study has been done. The bold color pattern serves to break up their outline and these striking monkeys are very difficult to see in the canopy amongst the leaves. They often freeze rather than flee when scared.

    Colobus do a crude form of brachiation, swinging and maneuvering with all four feet when moving through their territory. The rudimentary thumb, often only a “tubercle” in the thumb’s place, is thought to be part of the development toward brachiation. A full thumb would interfere with brachiation. Gibbon thumbs are similarly. When fleeing, Colobus do some fantastic leaping. Besides man and the occasional leopard, their primary predators are large eagles.

    Colobus have an unusual stomach. The essential feature is that it is sacculated, chambered like a ruminant or kangaroo. The expanded upper region is a storage chamber that is quickly packed with leaves during a feeding foray. It is separated from the lower acid region. Because of the high cellulose content, a leaf diet is difficult to digest. It requires an especially large portion of the day for quiet rest. Microbial assistance is necessary in any animal (even termites) that must deal with cellulose. Cows and other ruminants, plus such mammals as gorillas and the Colobus spend a large amount of time resting for digestion. Colobus rest over 50% of the day. Of the remainder of the time, 20% is devoted to eating, and 5% is spent traveling.</p>

<h5>Breeding & Growth</h5>
<p>Colobus are usually found in sexually mixed groups averaging 8-15 individuals, with only one fully adult male and 3 or 4 reproductive females. There is mutual grooming and seldom any squabbles. There is no real hierarchy, no genital swelling and no distinct breeding season. There tends to be a birth peak, timed so that weaning coincides with the greatest seasonal abundance of solid food.

    Breeding pairs move away from the group (and the female, accompanied by the male, moves away when she delivers). A 6-month gestation brings a single baby that hangs on under mom’s belly. For the first few days, it is held in place with one hand during a jump. Newborns are snow-white, with black skin. They will cling most of the time for the first month. They initially make little frog-like jumps, becoming more and more independent. Highly attractive to other females, infants may be carried by any in the group (infant transfer).</p>
